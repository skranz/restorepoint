Description: Debugging with restore points instead of break points. A restore
    point stores all local variables when called inside a function. The stored
    values can later be retrieved and evaluated in a modified R console that
    replicates the function's environment. To debug step by step, one can simply
    copy & paste the function body from the R script. Particularly convenient
    in combination with "RStudio". See the "Github" page inst/vignettes for a
    tutorial.
